    * mimick: Version 0.3.0.
    * api: **Breaking**: Fixed MMK_MATCHER_BIT_CMP being an invalid enum value.
    * api: **Breaking**: Renamed neq,leq,geq to ne,le,ge.
    * api: **Breaking**: Use comparisons operators when comparing parameters
      rather than using memcmp. This is more correct as memcmp doesn't
      account for endianness, but non-comparable types are no longer supported
      as parameters.

      instead of aborting if the mock initialization fails.
    * api: Fixed comparison matchers always matching for equality.
    * api: Fixed mmk_that not working.
    * arch: (x86_64,system-v) Fixed rax not being preserved when calling stubs.

    * core: **Breaking**: Ignore zero .times values in mmk_verify.
    * core: Better symbol lookup code, causing less crashes overall.

    * core: Fixed crashes with PIEs.
    * core: Fixed linux crash when a symbol isn't found.
    * core: Fixed vfprintf and abort mocks breaking mimick's panic handling.
